## June.

*I had been living in confusion until one day I heard a man said that he wants to be a great person. I didn't expect that I would be so impressed. Until today, I realize that i was always looking forward to living a fun and challenging life.*

*Overall, I think I should first think about the fields that I want to go deep with.*
